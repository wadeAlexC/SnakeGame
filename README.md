# SnakeGame

This is a Java remake of the classic arcade game "Snake." Use W,A,S, and D keys to move the Snake around. Eat blue food squares to
increase in size, and avoid running into yourself or the wall!

<b>Other controls:</b>

'P': Pause the game

'.': Raise the difficulty, or speed of the snake

',': Lower the difficulty, or speed of the snake


Good luck, and have fun!

About the code:

This project is my first attempt at threaded programming. I wrote it over a period of a month and recently fixed bugs, clarified comments, and added some functionality in order to have a more professional project to push to my repository.
