# SnakeGame

This is a Java remake of the classic arcade game "Snake." Use W,A,S, and D keys to move the Snake around. Eat blue food squares to
increase in size, and avoid running into yourself or the wall!

Other controls:

'P': Pause the game

'.': Raise the difficulty, or speed of the snake

',': Lower the difficulty, or speed of the snake


Good luck, and have fun!
